Estimation of Diffusion Coefficients

Diffusion coefficients are often estimated in scientific and engineering.
There can be many options and parameters involved in these estimations.
In scientific literature, the values are often not reported.
Having an open-source software repository for estimation of diffusion coefficients will
streamline reproduction and sensitivity analysis.

So far, this repository focuses on estimation of diffusivities in porous media.
